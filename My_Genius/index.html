                could leave early except
                i take the bus so i cant.</h6>

            <li>- If you could create a class from scratch, what would it be?</li>
            <h6>I would want a class on basic logic which is something that i think a lot of people could use a review
                of.</h6>

        <h2>I would want a class to be taught on logic</h2>
        <p>This class would focus on two major things:</p><br>
        <p>1. Critical Thinking: this would be about ensuring people focus on focusing on the whole picutre. This is a
            good idea because this school tends to have people only eveer focus on grades and classwork instead of being
            reasonable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2. Avoiding logical fallacies, this is important because of the fact that it would help people make sure that
            what they say and do makes sense.</p>
