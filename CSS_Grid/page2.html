            <h1>Why Birds arent real</h1>
            <p class="body-text">If you, like so many people, still believe in the lie that is the bird i invite you to
                look to the
                following: <br>
                the bird pictured above, known as a "pigeon" or as "Columba Livia" supposedly has an excellent sense of
                navigation <br>
                that allows it to always find its home no matter where it is. You know what that sounds like? three
                letters, G P S <br>
                GPS systems were developed in the 1970s to provide navigation for the US military, at the same time,
                president Nixon was <br>
                undergoin a massive campaign to kill all birds in the United States and replace them with drones.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">For more proof of this, GPS systems have a built in kil switch where no GPS will
                navigate above 1200 MPH
                or 65,000 feet of altitude. <br>
                interestingly, i very much doubt you have ever seen a bird fly above 65,000 feet or faster than 1200
                miles per hour (~10,000 KPH) </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                The Birds Aren't Real movement has been active since 1976. Once a preventative cause, our initial goal
                was to stop the genocide of real birds. Unfortunately this was unsuccessful, and the government has
                since replaced every living bird with robotic replicas. Now our movement's prerogative is to make
                everyone aware of this fact.</p>

            <h3>What Are We Trying To Do?</h3>
            <p class="body-text">The Birds Aren't Real movement exists to spread
                awareness that the U.S. Government genocided over 12 Billion birds from 1959-2001, and replaced these
                birds with surveillance drone replicas, which still watch us every day. Once a preventative cause, our
                initial goal was to stop the forced extinction of real birds. Unfortunately this was unsuccessful, and
                the government has since replaced every living bird with robotic replicas. Now our movement's
                prerogative is to make everyone aware of this fact.</p>
